## 🚦 Current Status

This package is currently under development and should be consider **ALPHA** in terms of state. I/We are currently accepting contributions and/or dedicated contributors to help develop and maintain this package.

## ✨ Features

This plugin provide a way to cache **HTTP requests** in order to **improve performance**. It's get inspired by varnish cache which is a popular caching solution.

The cache content is stored by a **provider**, which can be either an in-memory provider, a redis connection, a file system, or any other custom provider.
